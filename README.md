# The Aether Codex

<img src="./assets/banner.png" width="100%">

The Aether Codex is a collection of notes, official media, and publications describing technologies or events from 2021-2099 as retrieved by the founder. The documents are all written in ARIEL (Abstract Relational Information Exchange Language). You will need to acquire Visual Cortex enhancements and L3 Precognition to alleviate combinatorial explosion. Your crystals should ideally have between 3 to 10 XBs available during the translation.
